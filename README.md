A user-friendly web application that simulates a multi-specialty clinical case conference using a team of specialized Large Language Model (LLM) agents. This tool leverages Microsoft's AutoGen framework and Google's Gemini models to generate a collaborative diagnosis and management plan.

## About The Project

This project serves as a proof-of-concept for using multi-agent systems in medical education and clinical decision support. Instead of relying on a single AI model, it orchestrates a conversation between four distinct AI personas:

1.  **A Professor of Pediatrics**
2.  **A Professor of Internal Medicine**
3.  **A Professor of General Surgery**
4.  **A neutral Moderator**

The agents debate a clinical case, and the moderator synthesizes their discussion into a final, actionable plan.

### Features

-   **Modern Web UI:** Simple and intuitive interface built with Gradio.
-   **Agent Customization:** Easily modify agent names and system prompts directly in the UI.
-   **Secure API Key Management:** Set your API key via an environment variable or a secure field in the app.
-   **Adjustable Deliberation:** Control the conversation length with a "Max Rounds" slider.
-   **Transparent Reasoning:** View the full discussion transcript to understand how the final plan was reached.
-   **Easy Export:** Copy the final, formatted plan to your clipboard with a single click.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or higher
-   `pip` (Python package installer)
-   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/masoudrezaei/AI-Multi-Agent-Clinical-Consultation-Tool
    cd AI-Multi-Agent-Clinical-Consultation-Tool
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    -   **Windows:**
        ```sh
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    -   **macOS / Linux:**
        ```sh
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install pyautogen autogen google-generativeai 
    ```

4.  **Set up your Google API Key:**
    For the application to work, you need to provide your Google AI API key. The most secure way is to set it as an environment variable.

    -   **macOS / Linux:**
        ```sh
        export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
        ```
    -   **Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```sh
        set GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        ```
    -   **Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```sh
        $env:GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
        ```
    Alternatively, you can leave the environment variable unset and enter the key directly into the "Settings" tab in the web app each time you run it.

### Running the Application

1.  **Launch the app from your terminal:**
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

2.  **Open in browser:**
    The terminal will display a local URL, typically `http://127.0.0.1:7860`. Open this link in your web browser to start using the tool.
